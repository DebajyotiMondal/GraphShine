# GraphShine
GraphShine is a collection of algorithms for graph manipulations. The goal of this project is to provide a basic algorithmic foundation that could be used for diverse applications. The repository is slowly growing - please feel free to contribute to this repository. GraphShine is free for academic use, so far it has been developed in spare times.
