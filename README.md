# GraphShine
GraphShine is a collection of algorithms for graph manipulations. The goal of this project is to provide a basic algorithmic foundation that could be used for diverse applications. The repository is slowly growing - please feel free to contribute to this repository. GraphShine is free for academic use, so far it has been developed in spare times. 


Algorithms that have been implemented so far (all for undirected graphs)...

Finding Connected Components</br>
Finding BFS order</br>
Binary Search Tree (AVL)</br>
Segment Tree</br>
